Introduction
The manual creation of Bills of Materials (BOMs) from complex diagrams can be time-consuming and error-prone. To address this challenge, we propose an automated solution leveraging sophisticated image processing algorithms. This software aims to extract precise component information from schematic diagrams, facilitating the generation of comprehensive BOMs complete with specifications and market prices. By automating this process, we enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and ensure cost-effective procurement, thereby enhancing project reliability.

Domain
This project falls under the domain of automated documentation and procurement systems, particularly targeting industries involved in engineering, construction, electronics, and manufacturing.

Description
The software solution comprises several key components to automate the generation of Bills of Materials:
Image Processing Algorithms: Utilizing advanced image processing techniques, the software analyzes complex schematic diagrams to extract component information accurately.
Component Information Extraction: The algorithms identify and extract key details of each component depicted in the schematic diagrams, including part numbers, descriptions, and specifications.
Market Price Integration: The software interfaces with relevant databases or APIs to retrieve current market prices for each component based on its specifications. Integrate with APIs from electronic component suppliers like Digi-Key, Mouser, or Octopart to fetch real-time pricing.
BOM Generation: Based on the extracted component information and market prices, the software dynamically generates a comprehensive Bill of Materials, listing all required components along with their quantities, specifications, and individual costs.
Error Handling: The system incorporates error-checking mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of the extracted information and to alert users in case of discrepancies or missing data.
User Interface: The software features an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily upload schematic diagrams, review the generated BOMs, and make any necessary adjustments before finalizing the procurement process.

Conclusion
By automating the generation of Bills of Materials from schematic diagrams, this software solution aims to streamline procurement processes, improve accuracy, and enhance project reliability. With its ability to extract precise component information and integrate market prices, the system facilitates cost-effective procurement decisions and ensures comprehensive documentation for engineering projects.
